# Medical Insurance Price Prediction

### Description :
This project aims to develop a predictive model for medical insurance prices using machine learning techniques. Medical insurance costs are influenced by various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and others. Predicting these costs accurately can aid individuals in making informed decisions about their healthcare plans and assist insurance companies in setting premiums effectively.

The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals including their age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region, along with their corresponding medical insurance costs. Leveraging this dataset, we will explore different machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to build predictive models.
